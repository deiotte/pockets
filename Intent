This is where I'd like to try using Github for document version control.
  The goal is:
    to be able to move away from tools like SharePoint that require a subscription to enable simultaneous edits;
    to be able to move away from bespoke tools the Federal contractor industry uses to manage the continual flow of documentation created during the bid process;
